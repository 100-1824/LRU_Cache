# Cache Invalidation and Eviction Project in Python

## Overview

This project implements a cache system with cache invalidation and eviction strategies in Python. The cache uses the Least Recently Used (LRU) strategy to manage entries, and a Cache Manager is responsible for handling cache invalidation and eviction when necessary.

## Project Structure

1. **`LRUCache.py`:** Implementation of the LRU Cache with methods for adding, retrieving, and evicting entries.
2. **`CacheManager.py`:** Implementation of a Cache Manager that handles cache invalidation and eviction.
3. **`main.py`:** A sample usage of the cache system.

## Features

- **LRU Cache:** Implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache strategy for efficient management of cached entries.
  
- **Cache Manager:** Manages cache invalidation and eviction based on the LRU strategy.

- **Sample Usage:** Provides a sample usage scenario in `main.py` to demonstrate fetching, caching, and invalidating data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cache-invalidation-eviction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd cache-invalidation-eviction
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    This script demonstrates the usage of the cache system with cache invalidation and eviction.
